# - Manage turn order, game state, and win conditions.
# - Validate moves by coordinating the board, dictionary, and tile pile.
# - Update scores and player racks after successful moves.
# - Provide helper methods like play_move(), draw_tiles(), is_game_over().
# - Keep logic centralized so main.py stays minimal.
